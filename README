On the 20th of May 2010, Google announced the new Adnriod platform (version 2.2, codename Froyo).

In the new SDK, there is a funny little function : ActivityManager.isUserAMonkey();

This application will tell you if you are a monkey or not.

How to use the app : 
- I don't know, I don't have an android phone :)
- I guess you just have to screw with your phone a little (touch the screen frantically).
- If you see a message : "You did it! You're a monkey!" or "Oook!", you won.

Note for the developpers : 
The method isUserAMonkey() throws an exception when I test it with the command : 
adb shell monkey -p com.rumpl.monkey -v 500
Don't really know why since the documentation doesn't say much...
